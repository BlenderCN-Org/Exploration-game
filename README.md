# Exploration-game
I am currently developing an exploration game made in Unity, which I will use as my final degree project.

You can find my current versions of this game in /Unity-projects

Executable is generated from stable version (sequential version). I am working on a parallel version, which is inside /Unity-projects folder, but it is currently unstable.
